Intro.

The language for this project is American English. Specific heraldic terms come from British English, many derived from archaic French.

## Art and design


### Pattern groups

#### 06 - Grid
The substance of the pattern is continuously connected in 2 (or more) directions, often running perpendicular. These are 2-dimensional patterns. Grids normally resemble a lattice or network. The substance is represented with lit (or alternating) pixels, the void with unlit pixels. Some decoration is allowable. Grid patterns do not convey particular intent or semantic meaning; they are purely visual designs.

#### 07 - Checked
Alternating, geometric areas of contrast (light and dark), with areas tiling in 2-dimensions. Ideally with a near equal weighting of contrasting areas. Checked patterns often look like a checker board. There is no substance to represent, so lit and unlit pixels indicate light and dark areas. Some decoration is allowable. Checked patterns do not convey particular intent or semantic meaning; they are purely visual designs.
