## Acknowledgements

Inspired by studying software from the mid 1980's, to video games of the early 1990's. Influenced by the wonderful pixel artists of today. All artwork is drawn *tabula rasa*. Please let me know if any designs resemble the work of others.

Artwork and files created using [ABSpriteEditor](https://github.com/Pharap/ABSpriteEditor). Patterns tested and refined using [ASE](https://github.com/pmwasson/ASE) and [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy).  Additional file wrangling with [image2cpp](https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/). Data tweaking in LibreOffice, image conversions by ImageMagick, compressed with `pngslim` and metadata added with ExifTool.

Special thanks to @castpixel, @dw817, @felipemanga, @javl, @le-doux, @lexaloffle, @Pharap, @pmwasson.
