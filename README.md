## Acknowledgements

Inspired by studying software from the mid 1980's, to video games of the early 1990's. Influenced by the wonderful pixel artists of today. All artwork is drawn *tabula rasa*. Please let me know if any designs resemble the work of others.

Artwork and files created using [ABSpriteEditor](https://github.com/Pharap/ABSpriteEditor). Patterns tested and refined using [ASE](https://github.com/pmwasson/ASE), [bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) and [Pulp](https://play.date/pulp/about/). Data tweaking in LibreOffice. Image wrangling with ImageMagick, compressed with OptiPNG and `pngslim`, and metadata added with ExifTool.
